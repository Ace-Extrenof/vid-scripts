What is **Linguistics**?

---
By definition it is the scientific study of a language.

---
Yeah.... Doesn't really tell that much does it? OK, Linguistics is also-

---
- syntax
---
- semantics
---
- morphology
---
- phonetics
---
- phonology
---
- pragmatics
---

Still don't get it?

---
Yeah of course you didn't [roll back and black and white effect]

---
Let's consider your stupidity on this subject and start from simple.

---
What is a language?

---
- It is a structured form of communication that contains grammar and vocabulary 
---
[rewind + sound effect]

---
It is just a medium of communicating!

---

We all use languages even if you are deaf for blind

---
Without language there is no communication

---
Even if you don't agree, 

---
[which I don't really care about + roll back] 

---
if you pay enough attention you'll find yourself wrong.

---
In our eyes languages are pretty simple, 

---
really, 

---
it's really just some random sounds jumbled around in a specific order and structure that help us interpret what someone is trying to communicate to us.

---
But languages are more than that.

---
They're more complex than you think, 

---
you'll know if you have ever tried learning a language. 

---
And by that I mean something hard like Hindi

---
[or the other billion languages in India]

---
Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese or languages similar.

---
If you're an English man 

---
[or any other person really] 

---
and one day decide you want to learn, 

---
let's say, 

---
Hindi 

---
[And for god's sake there's no such language as Indian] 

---
you would find it very hard. 

---
*But learning a language is supposed to hard duh...*

---
Yes it is, 

---
but these languages will be more difficult 

---
because these languages introduce writing systems that are 

---
entirely different from other Latin or German based languages 

---
like Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Danish etc.

---
And sometimes even exclusively different grammar 

---
[that's going to make you shit your pants]

---
like in Mandarin or Japanese and many other languages.

---
*Ohk yeah I get the point but what does this have to do with Linguistics?*

---
That's pretty simple to answer. 

---
[Linguistics is the study of languages you dummy]. 

---
But what's the point of Linguistics.

---
And to be honest.... 

---
**I don't know** 

---
what did you expect?

---
I'll do all the research work 

---
[hell no I'm just some random 9th grader on the internet doing random shit]

---
Humans for the longest time have been doing stupid and pointless things 

---
and sometimes 

---
[only sometimes] 

---
they do something that will do something for the society. 

---
The complex languages we are now using have been evolved enough for us to use complex notions 

---
which allow us to convey most of things we want to communicate about.

---
Languages are a godsend that helps us to communicate and makes us united 

---
[that's what I would've said if we didn't kill each other for the stupidest of reasons]. 

---
Now onto Linguistics. 

---
Once upon a time some random Mesopotamian person was just sitting in his backyard and said -

---
**Hey cool**

---
**languages are-** 

---
**um...**

---
**interesting, **

---
**what if we made a field out of them?**

---
And that my friends is the whole history of it. 

---
[No it's not how would I know do your own research]

---
What does linguistics do?

---
It just tells us how a language is acquired and how it is processed.

---
[that's all I know I don't really have a degree in linguistics]

---
That's it really about linguistics! 

---
[it isn't and I have other topics to talk about-]

---
*That's okay but why would I even want to learn a language?*

---
Well the answer is easy really! 

---
To flex on your incompetent frie- 

---
[cut]

---
To consume literature of other countries.

---
*Why would I want to do that?* 

---
Because English literature only has so much to offer. [it offers a lot actually]

---
*Can't I just read translations?*

---
You can but where's the fun in that!

---
You can't really capture of authenticity of a anime with just it's subtitles can you? 

---
[or flex on your incompetent friends-]

---
And deep down you know yourself....

---
That you just want to learn Japanese and seem cool to all fellow weebs. 

---
[Don't lie, I know you]

---
*Okay okay I want to be a **authentic** weeb now? How do I learn Japanese(or any other language)* 

---
There's not really any absolute way, 

---
every language can be learned in many different ways 

---
and there are like a million different videos already covering that topic 

---
on possibly every language on the Youtube 

---
so you're on your own on that journey           :)

---
But there is a somewhat well-established framework for learning languages -

---
- DON'T USE DUOLINGO [absolute shit]

---
- LEARN THE WRITING SYSTEM [don't get too much absorbed into it but learn it just so you can read your target language somewhat]

---
- GET DOWN SOME VOCABULARY [absolutely important , don't ignore this or you won't even get past the speaking part]

---
- GET DOWN BASIC GRAMMAR [essential for learning basic structure of your target language]

---
- IMMERSION [one of the most important parts, consume content extensively of your target language. It may seem like gibberish at first but trust me it works and that's how we all learned languages till now]

---

And that's it really. 

---
I bet you just stumbled randomly on this channel, 

---
and if you have watched this far thank you. 

---
But this isn't going to be a linguistics channel, 

---
I made this channel just so I could waste my time on talking random shit.

---
If you do so happen to be interested in that 

---
or want me to talk more about linguistics 

---
or anything really. 

---
Let me know! 

---
I like to talk about random shit

---
Bye bye!
